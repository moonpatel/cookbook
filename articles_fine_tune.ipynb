      "Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is one of the most popular services provided by Amazon AWS. It makes it easy for organizations to store large amounts of data or objects such as pictures, websites, or database backups. In large organizations or even for individual users, based on the nature of the data objects stored in S3 and the corresponding business rules, the access control that needs to be implemented on the objects can be very flexible.\n",
      "AWS S3 access points simplify data access for any AWS service or customer application that stores data in S3.. Access points are named network endpoints that you can use to perform S3 object operations such as GetObject and PutObject. Each access point has unique permissions and network controls that S3 enforces each time you make a request through the access point. \n",
      "Use Case of S3 Access Points\n",
      "Suppose you work for a global company working in various geographic regions. You can use S3 storage to store data in regional buckets. Let the sales team working in these regions. Sales Teams Need access to their region data only. Then you Should Configure Access Points Specific to each region. So Each Sales Team can only access data in their region bucket. \n",
      "You can Configure a Custom Origin which allows specific Set of networks within the VPC to connect to the Access point. If you have mobile and web application  You can create single access point and configure load balancing architecture to balance the traffic.\n",
      "Before Access Policy management for the bucket, it was  the most used and easiest  way to manage the access from  authenticated users for the most important part and then takes a lengthy route to enable/disaable the public access, and enabling the API Access. As access points created from buckets are connected easily and directly, and has sem...API Access, where each owner can get their data faster and more securely S3 is more integrated with IAM, you can create different access points for different types of access patterns like web hosting, analytics and reporting. Also, it acts as a funnel for all monitoring and access.\n",
      "Bucket Framework: Neither very high data nor frequent requests, buckets are used and have set a certain default policy for it, also there is no segregation of access From authenticated user, public access, and through the APIs.\n",
      "Why Use Access Points?\n",
      "Managing access control lists (ACLs) and bucket policies can become quite cumbersome if you have a lot of objects in a single bucket with unique access requirements for each object.\n",
      "When there is a situation in which customers in different geographical regions need access to a single bucket, you can use S3 access points to simplify the process and apply access policy for the particular region only.\n",
      "By using access points, you can have more granular control over how users can access your bucket and also the possibility to apply resource-specific access policies.\n",
      "You can also restrict the public access you have on your bucket if needed.\n",
      "You can have the possibility to track the access requests by using access logs which can be enabled at the time of creating the access point.\n",

      "In a recent study by Verizon, 63% of the confirmed data breaches are due to either weak, stolen, or default passwords used. There is a saying in the cybersecurity world that goes like this “No matter how good your chain is it’s only as strong as your weakest link.” and exactly hackers use the weakest links in the organization to infiltrate. They usually use phishing attacks to infiltrate an organization and if they get at least one person to fall for it, it’s a serious turn of events from thereon. They use the stolen credentials to plant back doors, install malware or exfiltrate confidential data, all of which will cause serious losses for an organization.\n",
      "How Identity and Access Management Works?\n",
      "AWS(Amazon Web Services) will allows you to maintain the fine-grained permissions  to the AWS account and the services provided Amazon cloud. You can  manage the permissions to the individual users or you can manage the permissions to certain users as group and roles will helps you to manage the permissions to the resources. \n",
      "What Is Identity and Access Management(IAM)?\n",
      "Identity and Access Management (IAM) is a combination of policies and technologies that allows organizations to identify users and provide the right form of access as and when required. There has been a burst in the market with new applications, and the requirement for an organization to use these applications has increased drastically. The services and resources you want to access can be specified in IAM. IAM doesn’t provide any replica or backup.  IAM can be used for many purposes such as, if one want’s to control access of individual and group access for your AWS resources. With IAM policies, managing permissions to your workforce and systems to ensure least-privilege permissions becomes easier. The AWS IAM is a global service.\n",

      "Groups\n",
      "Policies\n",
      " With these new applications being created over the cloud, mobile and on-premise can hold sensitive and regulated information. It’s no longer acceptable and feasible to just create an Identity server and provide access based on the requests. In current times an organization should be able to track the flow of information and provide least privileged access as and when required, obviously with a large workforce and new applications being added every day it becomes quite difficult to do the same. So organizations specifically concentrate on managing identity and its access with the help of a few IAM tools. It’s quite obvious that it is very difficult for a single tool to manage everything but there are multiple IAM tools in the market that help the organizations with any of the few services given below. \n",
      "IAM Identities Classified As\n",
      "IAM Users\n",
      "IAM Groups\n",
      "IAM Roles\n",
      "Root user \n",
      "The root user will automatically be created and granted unrestricted rights. We can create an admin user with fewer powers to control the entire Amazon account.\n",
      "IAM Users\n",
      "We can utilize IAM users to access the AWS Console and their administrative permissions differ from those of the Root user and if we can keep track of their login information.\n",
      "Example\n",
      "With the aid of IAM users, we can accomplish our goal of giving a specific person access to every service available in the Amazon dashboard with only a limited set of permissions, such as read-only access. Let’s say user-1 is a user that I want to have read-only access to the EC2 instance and no additional permissions, such as create, delete, or update. By creating an IAM user and attaching user-1 to that IAM user, we may allow the user access to the EC2 instance with the required permissions.\n",
      "IAM Groups\n",
      "A group is a collection of users, and a single person can be a member of several groups. With the aid of groups, we can manage permissions for many users quickly and efficiently.\n",
      "Example\n",
      "Consider two users named user-1 and user-2. If we want to grant user-1 specific permissions, such as the ability to delete, create, and update the auto-calling group only, and if we want to grant user-2 all the necessary permissions to maintain the auto-scaling group as well as the ability to maintain EC2,S3 we can create groups and add this user to them. If a new user is added, we can add that user to the required group with the necessary permissions.\n",
      "IAM Roles\n",
      "While policies cannot be directly given to any of the services accessible through the Amazon dashboard, IAM roles are similar to IAM users in that they may be assumed by anybody who requires them. By using roles, we can provide AWS Services access rights to other AWS Services.\n",
      "Example\n",
      "Consider Amazon EKS. In order to maintain an autoscaling group, AWS eks needs access to EC2 instances. Since we can’t attach policies directly to the eks in this situation, we must build a role and then attach the necessary policies to that specific role and attach that particular role to EKS. \n",
      "IAM Policies \n",
      "IAM Policies can manage access for AWS by attaching them to the IAM Identities or resources IAM policies defines permissions of AWS identities and AWS resources when a user or any resource makes a request to AWS will validate these policies and confirms whether the request to be allowed or to be denied. AWS policies are stored in the form of Jason format the number of policies to be attached to particular IAM identities depends upon no.of permissions required for one IAM identity. IAM identity can have multiple policies attached to them.  \n",

      "Market for IAM: Current situation of the market, there are three market leaders (Okta, SailPoint and Cyberark) who master one of the three domains (Identity Management, Identity Governance and Privilege access management), according to Gartner and Forrester reports. These companies have developed solutions and are still developing new solutions that allow an organization to manage identity and its access securely without any hindrances in the workflow.
